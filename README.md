# ysoserial_payloads_generator
A bash script that generates base64-encoded payloads ready to use for exploitation of insecure deserialization vulnerabilites in Java applications (needs improvements, some payloads fails).

## Payloads that the script doesn't generate at the moment are:
- AspectJWeaver
- C3P0
- FileUpload1
- JRMPListener
- JSON1
- Jython1
- Myfaces2
- Wicket1

Any contribution is very welcome!
